        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Bread Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
            <li>1 cup whole fat plain Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon grnulated garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Garlic Topping:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic granules</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, yogurt, garlic granules, Italian seasoning, and salt in a bowl; mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Dust work surface with more flour. Transfer dough to work surface. Knead dough for 8 to 10 minutes with the palm of your hand. Add more flour (1 teaspoon at a time) as needed to keep dough from being too sticky.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat (such as SilpatÂ®).</li>
            <li>Shape dough into a rounded loaf. Using a bench scraper, cut off 8 wedges of dough. Roll each wedge of dough into a rope shape and tie into knots. Place knots onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until knots are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine melted butter, oil, garlic granules, and parsley for topping in a small glass bowl. Brush mixture over the warm knots.</li>
        </ol>
